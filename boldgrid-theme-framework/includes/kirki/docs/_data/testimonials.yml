  wpusername: liddika
  link: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/the-best-part-is-that-the-developer-is-100-active/
  content: I have used several option frameworks, unfortunately pretty much all of them have very slow development speed, and if there is a bug, it’s there for years. The developer of this plugin is the opposite. He is fully active on github, listens to the feedback and implements them. Best option framework by far!

  content: I’m developing a new theme and wanted to incorporate Kirki into it. I ran into a few problems and I approached the developer. He asked if I could send him the theme, which I did and within 5 min he corrected the issues I was having! Not only did he explain what I was doing wrong but he took time out of his schedule to do it. That says a lot about the developer. Great plugin! Great support! I highly recommend this plugin to anyone developer. Thanks again for the help and all you do.
