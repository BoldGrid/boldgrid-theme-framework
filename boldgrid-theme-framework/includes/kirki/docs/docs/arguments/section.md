All controls in the WordPress Customizer must belong to a section. If a control is orphan and not assigned to an existing section then it will not be displayed. In the `section` argument you will have to use the unique ID of your section.

For info on how to create sections please refer to the [sections documentation](../adding-panels-and-sections).
